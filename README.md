## About the project

<p align="justify">This repository is a part of Digital Signal Processing Systems course in the academic year 2023/2024. at Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Banja Luka. The project it contains focuses on implementing audio effects, applicable to an audio signal, addressing requirements such as generating reference signals in Python, effect implementation on the ADSP processor, performance analysis, and optionally, correcting algorithm implementation on the DSP. Implemented effects within this repository include delay, echo, flanger, tremolo, and bit crusher, located in the 'python' subfolder. The C implementation is in the 'CCES' subfolder, utilizing the CCES development environment designed for the targeted ADSP-1489 platform. The 'docs' subfolder contains documentation, along with the working version of the report.
